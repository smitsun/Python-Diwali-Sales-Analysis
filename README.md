Employing Python and libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn, I conducted a Diwali Sales Analysis project. Through meticulous data manipulation and visualization, the analysis uncovered patterns in product sales, customer behavior, and overall market trends during the festive season. This project equips businesses with actionable insights, enabling them to refine strategies and maximize revenue potential in subsequent Diwali celebrations.
